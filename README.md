# ng-chrome-extension-kit
A library that helps you develop chrome extensions with angular. implements chrome extensions with mocks 


# Why use this library

building a chrome extension is easy, but now it is even easier. 

when you develop, apis like chrome's sync are not available. 
plus, they are not angular friendly. 

with my library, you will not see `undefined` errors while developing and using missing chrome apis and you will get an angular friendly api.
